Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Exercises

Overview

This repository contains my solutions and exercises from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart. The purpose of this project is to refresh and strengthen my Python programming skills by working through practical tasks and projects outlined in the book.

About the Book

"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" is a comprehensive guide to learning Python through hands-on projects. It covers fundamental concepts such as data structures, file I/O, regular expressions, and automation tasks, making it an excellent resource for beginners and intermediate learners.

Repository Structure





Each folder corresponds to a chapter or section of the book.



Files within folders contain my solutions to exercises, projects, or additional practice tasks.



Code is written in Python and includes comments for clarity and understanding.

Goals





Refresh core Python concepts (lists, dictionaries, functions, OOP, etc.).



Gain practical experience with automation tasks (e.g., file manipulation, web scraping).



Build a portfolio of Python scripts to demonstrate programming proficiency.

How to Use





Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/peatahaya/automateBoringStuff.git



Navigate to a specific chapter or exercise folder.



Run the Python scripts using a Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended).

Prerequisites





Python 3.x installed.



Basic understanding of Python programming.



Optional: Install dependencies (if any) listed in specific project folders.

Progress

I am currently working through the chapters sequentially, updating the repository with new solutions as I complete them. Check back for updates!
